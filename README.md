# Continual
###  Run tasks on interval.

Simple continual task runner written in node js.  
  
  
## Installation  
Continual is proffered to be installed globally.  
```
[Installation command here whenever package is published]
```
But should run fine as a local installation too.  
After installation, jobs and notifiers have to be installed.  
Check the [Jobs](#jobs) section for links to my personal jobs, and [Notifiers](#notifiers) section for my notifiers.

  
## Usage
Running continual (if installed globally) should be as easy as:
```
> continual
```
  
But my guesses are that you are not reading this cause you wish to know how to start it.  
Install your prefered notifiers and jobs, or write your own.  
[Process here... or a wiki link...]

## Jobs
[phpunit ...]

## Notifiers
[osx-terminal ...]
