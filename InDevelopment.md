## Planned and in dev.

There is a few things that is planned to be added asap.  
I will list the most important ones here...  


###### Interval.
The interval value in the `Jobs` should not be in minutes only.  

###### Job and Notifier installer.
Some type of installation command is in the planning phase.  
I will get back to this later on.
